    "00:00:00": "This has to do with adenosine receptor modulation. The important thing to do is not continue to consume that elevated level of caffeine, which is what most people do. And then they set a new higher baseline just to feel normal. The key thing is to just manage to get through that crash day, manage to get through that one day where you feel a little less good or maybe even down a bit, get outside a bit, get some more sunshine. We know that spikes your cortisol in a good way, right? It can increase the catecholamines, dopamine, et cetera. Get a little bit more sunlight, get a little bit more movement, get outside, do something to offset those feelings of malaise and then get right back to your original goal level of caffeine each day. There's no use in getting so quantitative that you make your life miserable, you know, measuring things out like a laboratory chemist. If you're that type and you want to do that, be my guest. But unless you're taking caffeine in pill form, it's very, very hard to get extremely exact about the amount of caffeine that you're ingesting. So it is okay to eyeball it, but understand the contour of how caffeine works and what the caffeine performance enhancing effect comes from. It comes from a caffeine intake above baseline. Understand that anytime you go above baseline with your caffeine intake, there's the potential of some anxiety. Understand that there's going to be a slight withdrawal effect that lasts about 24 to 48 hours. Battle through that short period and you'll be right back where you started and where you need to be so that you can enjoy caffeine on a daily basis and derive the benefits because there are many benefits to drinking caffeine and avoiding some of the potential hazards. And again, if you're a young person, I recommend delaying that caffeine intake maybe, I don't know, 10 years. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast's standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab. com. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel. It's really two-fold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. and to fund research in particular research done on human beings so not animal models but on human beings which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health, physical health and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Humberton Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs, you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you'll of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes and not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab. com slash premium. Again, that's hubermanlab. com slash premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science."
