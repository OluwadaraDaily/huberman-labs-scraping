      "00:00:00": "In order for your neurons to function properly, you need electrolytes in your system, and you need to be well hydrated. There's a lot of research to support the fact that if you are even mildly dehydrated, that your cognition suffers, your physical performance suffers, and your sleep can also suffer. So getting adequate electrolytes and hydration is key, and Element allows you to do that. I typically mix Element into 16 to 32 ounces of water and drink that first thing in the morning. I'll also drink another one during exercise, and sometimes another one after exercise as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot or it's a particularly hot day. If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement.com slash Huberman, and that's spelled lmnt.com slash Huberman. And you can claim a free sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com slash Huberman to claim a free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are the absolute highest quality. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. And I say that because when we are not sleeping well or enough, all of those things suffer.",
